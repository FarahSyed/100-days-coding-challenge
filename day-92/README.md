## Streaming

### Overview
Streaming in Next.js optimizes the delivery of content by breaking it into smaller chunks, rendering them progressively. This method significantly enhances performance and user experience.

### Key Concepts

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Delivers parts of the HTML to the client incrementally as they are generated.
- **React Suspense**: Manages loading states of UI components, enabling efficient streaming of data and components.

### Benefits
- **Faster Initial Load**: Reduces the time users wait for the first meaningful content.
- **Improved User Experience**: Provides a smoother, more responsive interface.
- **Reduced Time to Interactive**: Ensures quicker interaction capabilities for users.
