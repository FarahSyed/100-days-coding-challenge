// 1. Working with variables
let admin;
let name;
name = "John";
admin = name;
alert(admin);


// 2. Giving the right name
let ourPlanet = "Earth";
let user = "Ali";


// 3. Uppercase const?
const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase?
// The variable BIRTHDAY can be in uppercase as birthdays are constant and can't be changed.

const age = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?
// No, it's appropriate to keep "age" in lowercase as it changes every year.
