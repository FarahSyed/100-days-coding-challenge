# Day-84 Task:

## Description
Today's task is to learn about:

- [Adding Interactivity with State](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/updating-state)
- [Displaying Data with Props](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/from-react-to-nextjs)


## Adding Interactivity with State:
In this section, we explore how to add interactivity to our React applications by using state. State allows us to create dynamic and interactive components that can change in response to user actions or other events. By understanding state management, we can build more complex and responsive applications.

## Displaying Data with Props:
From React to Next.js:
Here, we transition from understanding the basics of React to leveraging the powerful features of Next.js. We learn how Next.js builds on top of React to provide server-side rendering, static site generation, and other optimizations that make our web applications more performant and scalable.
