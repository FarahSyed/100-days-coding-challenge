# Day-86 Task:

## Description
Today's task is to learn about:

- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)
- [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/getting-started)


## Learn Next.js:
Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality like server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications. It provides many features out of the box, such as automatic code splitting, routing, and server-side rendering.

To get started with learning Next.js, the tutorial covers various topics, including:

- Creating a new Next.js app.
- Understanding Next.js pages and routing.
- Building dynamic pages with data fetching.
- Deploying a Next.js app.


## Getting Started:
To get started with Next.js, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js:** Next.js requires Node.js to run. You can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a new Next.js app:** You can create a new Next.js app using the following command in your terminal:

```
npx create-next-app nextjs-dashboard
```

3. **Navigate into your new Next.js app directory:**

```
cd my-next-app
```

4. **Start the development server:**
```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open your Next.js app in your default web browser.

5. **Explore the project structure:**

Next.js projects have a predefined structure that includes folders like `pages`, `public`, `styles`, and `components`. The `pages` directory contains your application's routes.

6. **Edit `pages/index.js` and save your changes.** The Next.js development server will automatically reload the page with your updates.

7. **Build your Next.js app for production:**
```
npm run dev
```
This command will create an optimized production build of your Next.js app.

8. **Deploy your Next.js app:** Next.js apps can be deployed to various hosting platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or your own server. Follow the deployment instructions provided by your chosen hosting platform.

By following these steps, you can get started with Next.js and begin building powerful React applications with server-side rendering and other advanced features.
