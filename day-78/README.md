## Web Vitals
Web Vitals are a set of metrics designed by Google to measure and ensure a healthy, user-friendly website experience. These metrics focus on three key aspects:

#### Loading: 
- How quickly the main content of a page is visible (Largest Contentful Paint - LCP).

#### Interactivity:
- The responsiveness of a page (First Input Delay - FID).

#### Visual Stability: 
- Ensuring that content remains stable and doesn't shift unexpectedly (Cumulative Layout Shift - CLS).  

Understanding and optimizing for Web Vitals is crucial for enhancing user experience and improving website performance.
