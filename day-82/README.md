- [Getting Started with React](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/getting-started-with-react)


## Updating UI with JavaScript

1. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - Use JavaScript to dynamically update HTML elements.
   - Example: Creating and appending an `<h1>` element to a `<div>`.

2. **Imperative vs. Declarative Programming**:
   - **Imperative**: Writing detailed instructions on how to update the UI (e.g., DOM methods).
   - **Declarative**: Describing what the UI should look like, and letting the library handle the updates (e.g., React).

3. **HTML vs. DOM**:
   - HTML represents initial content; DOM represents the updated content post JavaScript execution.

4. **Benefits of Declarative Programming**:
   - Simplifies development by abstracting complex DOM manipulations.
   - React is a popular library that follows this approach.


## Getting Started with React

1. **Introduction to React**:
   - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces declaratively.
   - Allows developers to build reusable UI components.

2. **Setting Up a React Project**:
   - Create a new project or add React to an existing project.
   - Learn about JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML and is used with React.

3. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Break down the UI into small, manageable components.
   - Each component handles its own rendering and state management.
